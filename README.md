## Quickstart

The most convenient way to use D2 is to just run it as a CLI executable to
produce SVGs from `.d2` files.

```sh
# First, install D2
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --

echo 'x -> y -> z' > in.d2
d2 --watch in.d2 out.svg
```

A browser window will open with `out.svg` and live-reload on changes to `in.d2`.

## Install

For detailed installation docs with examples see [./docs/INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).

### Install script

The recommended way to install is to run our install script, which will figure out the
best way to install based on your machine.

```sh
# With --dry-run the install script will print the commands it will use
# to install without actually installing so you know what it's going to do.
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
# If things look good, install for real.
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --
```

We have precompiled binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/releases)
page for macOS and Linux. For both amd64 and arm64. We will release package manager
distributions like .rpm, .deb soon. d2 is on homebrew with our tap. See [./docs/INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).

We'll have a docker image soon too.

To uninstall:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall --dry-run
# If things look good, uninstall for real.
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

> warn: Our binary releases aren't fully portable like normal Go binaries due to the C
> dependency on v8go for executing dagre.

### Install from source

Alternatively, you can install from source:

```sh
go install oss.terrastruct.com/d2/cmd/d2@latest
```

## D2 as a library

In addition to being a runnable CLI tool, D2 can also be used to produce diagrams from
Go programs.

```go
import (
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2compiler"
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2exporter"
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2layouts/d2dagrelayout"
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2renderers/textmeasure"
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2themes/d2themescatalog"
)

func main() {
  graph, err := d2compiler.Compile("", strings.NewReader("x -> y"), &d2compiler.CompileOptions{ UTF16: true })
  ruler, err := textmeasure.NewRuler()
  err = graph.SetDimensions(nil, ruler)
  err = d2dagrelayout.Layout(ctx, graph)
  diagram, err := d2exporter.Export(ctx, graph, d2themescatalog.NeutralDefault)
  ioutil.WriteFile(filepath.Join("out.svg"), d2svg.Render(*diagram), 0600)
}
```

D2 is built to be hackable -- the language has an API built on top of it to make edits
programmatically.

```go
import (
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2oracle"
  "github.com/terrastruct/d2/d2format"
)

// ...modifying the diagram `x -> y` from above
// Create a shape with the ID, "meow"
graph, err = d2oracle.Create(graph, "meow")
// Style the shape green
graph, err = d2oracle.Set(graph, "meow.style.fill", "green")
// Create a shape with the ID, "cat"
graph, err = d2oracle.Create(graph, "cat")
// Move the shape "meow" inside the container "cat"
graph, err = d2oracle.Move(graph, "meow", "cat.meow")
// Prints formatted D2 code
println(d2format.Format(graph.AST))
```

This makes it easy to build functionality on top of D2. Terrastruct uses the above API to
implement editing of D2 from mouse actions in a visual interface.

## Themes

D2 includes a variety of official themes to style your diagrams beautifully right out of
the box. See [./d2themes](./d2themes) to browse the available themes and make or
contribute your own creation.

## Fonts

D2 ships with "Source Sans Pro" as the font in renders. If you wish to use a different
one, please see [./d2renderers/d2fonts](./d2renderers/d2fonts).

## Export file types

D2 currently supports SVG exports. More coming soon.

## Language tooling

D2 is designed with language tooling in mind. D2's parser can parse multiple errors from a
broken program, has an autoformatter, syntax highlighting, and we have plans for LSP's and
more. Good language tooling is necessary for creating and maintaining large diagrams.

The extensions for VSCode and Vim can be found in the [Related](#related) section.

## Plugins

D2 is designed to be extensible and composable. The plugin system allows you to
change out layout engines and customize the rendering pipeline. Plugins can either be
bundled with the build or separately installed as a standalone binary.

**Layout engines**:

- [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) (default, bundled): A fast, directed graph
  layout engine that produces layered/hierarchical layouts. Based on Graphviz's DOT
  algorithm.
- [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) (bundled): A directed graph layout engine
  particularly suited for node-link diagrams with an inherent direction and ports.
- [TALA](https://github.com/terrastruct/TALA) (binary): Novel layout engine designed
  specifically for software architecture diagrams. Requires separate install, visit the
  Github page for more.

D2 intends to integrate with a variety of layout engines, e.g. `dot`, as well as
single-purpose layout types like sequence diagrams. You can choose whichever layout engine
you like and works best for the diagram you're making.
