D2 0.6.2 makes grid diagrams significantly more powerful. Namely, connections can now be made from grid elements to other grid elements. This enables diagrams like the following.

In addition, another significant feature is that using the ELK layout engine will now route SQL diagrams to their exact columns.

Note that all previous playground links will be broken given the encoding change. The encoding used to use the keyword set as compression dictionary, but it no longer does, so this will be the last time playground links break.

#### Features üöÄ

- ELK routes `sql_table` edges to the exact columns (ty @landmaj) [#1681](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1681)
- Unfilled triangle arrowhead is available. [#1711](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1711)
- Grid containers customize label positions. [#1715](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1715)
- A single board from a multi-board diagram can be rendered with `--target` flag. [#1725](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1725)

#### Improvements üßπ

- Grid cells can contain nested edges [#1629](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1629)
- Edges can go across constant `near`s, sequence diagrams, and grids, including nested ones. [#1631](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1631)
- All vars defined in a scope are accessible everywhere in that scope, i.e., an object can use a var defined after itself. [#1695](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1695)
- Encoding API switches to standard zlib encoding so that decoding doesn't depend on source. [#1709](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1709)
- `currentcolor` is accepted as a color option to inherit parent colors. (ty @hboomsma) [#1700](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1700)
- Grid containers can be sized with `width`/`height` even when using a layout plugin without that feature. [#1731](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1731)
- Watch mode watches for changes in both the input file and imported files [#1720](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1720)
