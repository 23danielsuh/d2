D2 0.3 is here! 

## Major updates:

- SVG sizes are ~**5%** of what they were in D2 0.2. 
  - The disproportionately largest contributor to this size was the font. Instead of encoding the entire font, D2 now only bundles only the used part of it (e.g. if you don't use the letter "b", the font encoding for "b" won't be included).
- The first practical applications of multi-board compositions are here: animations. Composition is among D2's most powerful features, and these first applications are just the tip of the iceberg. Stay tuned for more in upcoming 0.3.x releases.

- Customizable fonts. You can pass in whatever you want to use through the command line.
