- `elk` layouts favor balance over straight edges. [#1028](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1028)
- `elk` layouts have nicer margins between node boundaries and edges. [#1028](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1028)
- `sketch` draws connections with less roughness, which especially improves look of corner bends in ELK. [#1014](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1014)
